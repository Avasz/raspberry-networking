This script can help users to forward internet from interface to another.

##Some usage:
>1. Sometimes you may want internet in your desktop which does not have wifi receiver & you do not have access to the wired hub, but your laptop has wifi.
>2. The hotspot internet that you are subscribed to may not have good signal all over your house. Connect to internet from your laptop/device/raspberry-pi/whatever and route the internet to your wireless router.
>3. The same f***ing hotspot does not allow more than one logins from same user. 
>4. You are using your neigbour's wifi? :D

Bleh, run your imaginations wild. You may find various usage for it.


##My usage:
>Tethered mobile wifi to raspberry pi. --> Raspberry Pi gets internet.
>Rasberry pi forwards internet to wireless router via it's ethernet port.
>Internet all over my house.
>Raspberry pi is loaded with Raspbmc: XBMC ported to raspberry pi.
>All my devices are now connected to the wireless router, I can use my phone as remote for xbmc and share media from my laptop & mobile to the xbmc.

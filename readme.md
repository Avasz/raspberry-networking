This simple script will help you to forward internet from your mobile sets connected via usb to the raspberry pi to the ethernet port.

In short:

You can share your mobile internet to your router via raspberry pi.

Modify the script according to your interfaces.

Here:
Wired port: eth0
Mobile interface: usb0
IP for raspberry pi: 172.18.0.1
Subnet: 255.255.255.0 etc..

You may want to change your interfaces.


Usage:
The ip of raspberry pi will be 172.18.0.1
You can connect to your pi with that ip.
Usually useful in raspbmc.
More useful if you don't have a wired internet but want to treat your pi with internet via tethering wifi or mobile data in the same time route the internet in your home too via a spare wireless router which you already have (assume :D)
Other usage, find yourself.
Bleh, this readme sucks :D
